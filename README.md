- Files are reasonably sized to process on the client side.
- Matching is done solely by `transaction_reference`.

- CSV format must be consistent and valid for reliable results.
- No authentication or user management.
- Focused on transaction reconciliation only ‚Äî no financial calculations or adjustments.
- Designed as a standalone tool suitable for small to medium CSV files.
